# FlowSim: Workload Simulation Pipeline

FlowSim is a lightweight and extensible toolchain for simulating and analyzing kernel-level performance based on real-world inference workloads. It bridges high-level framework profiling and low-level hardware simulation through a three-stage workflow:

1. **Profiling**: Extracts real AI workload traces from optimized inference frameworks (e.g., [sglang](https://docs.sglang.ai/)), capturing operator-level execution from production-like workloads.
2. **Trace Translation**: Converts profiled pytorch traces into detailed kernel-level representations enriched with fine-grained tensor information such as shapes and data types.
3. **Simulation**: Feeds the translated traces into hardware-level simulators (e.g., LLMCompass) to enable GPU kernel simulation, simulator calibration, and performance prediction.

Although simulation is driven at the operator/kernel level, performance analysis and observation are performed end-to-end (E2E) to provide a holistic view of workload behavior.

FlowSim is most suitable for:

- Developers who need detailed, fine-grained end-to-end workload profiling.
- Researchers and simulator developers who require accurate kernel-level traces to calibrate and evaluate GPU performance simulators.

The project supports rapid deployment using Docker, includes scripts for environment setup and profiling, and offers flexible configuration options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with NVIDIA GPU(s) (for profiling)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with [NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [NVIDIA NGC account](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key) for pulling NVIDIA base images
- ~50GB disk space for images and traces

**Note:** Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` before building, as the LLMCompass submodule requires initialization.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
cd /path/to/flowsim
make build-docker
```

This creates a local image named `flowsim-image` with FlowSim patches already applied to sglang.

On Blackwell (GB200/B200, sm_100+) use the CUDA 13 image instead — `cuda12.6.dockerfile`
builds kernels for sm_90 and below:

```bash
make build-docker-sglang
```

This layers FlowSim on top of the official `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.16-cu130` release image
(which already ships matching CUDA 13 / FlashInfer / DeepGEMM builds for amd64 and arm64)
rather than building sglang from source, so it is also much faster. Override the base with
`make build-docker-sglang SGLANG_IMAGE=...`; it must match the `workload/framework/sglang`
submodule commit, since `patches/hook-v0516.patch` is applied to the sglang checkout inside
the image. The build needs no network access.

### 2. Profile (Generate Traces)

Use `flowsim submit` to capture stage-separated traces (EXTEND + DECODE), parse them, and run cross-rank analysis — all in one step. See [Stage Profiling](#stage-profiling) for how stages and collection modes work.

```bash
pip install -e .
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect all \
    --model-path workload/models/configs/Qwen3-235B-A22B \
    --tp 1 --bs 1 --input-len 2048 --existing-ctx 0 --decode-tokens 2 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy"
```

For K8s / Slurm clusters, see [Scheduler Backends](#scheduler-backends).

**Tip:** Trace files can be visualized at [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/). For multi-GPU traces, merge them first:
```bash
python utils/merge_trace.py --trace_dir stage_traces/local/*/bs1_input2048_ctx0 --output merged.json
```

### 3. Simulate (Run Hardware Simulation)

Build and start the LLMCompass backend, then submit parsed traces for kernel-level simulation:

```bash
# Build backend image
sudo docker build -t llmcompass-backend -f backend/LLMCompass/Dockerfile backend/LLMCompass/

# Terminal 1: Start backend
sudo docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 llmcompass-backend

# Terminal 2: Run simulation
sudo docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v /data/flowsim:/workspace \
  flowsim-image \
  python -m scripts.run_simulate \
    --trace-file /workspace/traces/bs1_input2048_ctx0/*-TP-0-EXTEND.trace.json.gz \
    --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
    --artifact-dir /workspace/simulate/llmcompass
```

### 4. Inspect Results

```bash
ls -lh /data/flowsim/traces/       # Stage-separated traces + parsed CSVs
ls -lh /data/flowsim/simulate/     # Simulation artifacts
```

## Stage Profiling

FlowSim performs **stage-separated** profiling: it captures prefill (EXTEND) and decode traces independently, parses them, runs cross-rank kernel analysis, and optionally collects kernel input shapes.

### How stages work

Each profiling request produces **two** stage-separated traces:
- **EXTEND** (prefill) — processes `input_len` new tokens (with optional `existing_ctx` tokens already in KV cache)
- **DECODE** — captures `decode-tokens` decode batch steps (default 2)

### Collection modes

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--collect perf` | Profile a single (bs, input_len, existing_ctx) point → trace → parse → cross-rank analysis |
| `--collect shapes` | Re-run **without CUDA graph** to capture kernel input shapes, then merge into timing CSVs |
| `--collect all` | Both phases back-to-back (auto-restarts the server in between) |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic profiling
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect perf \
    --model-path workload/models/configs/Qwen3-235B-A22B \
    --tp 1 --bs 1 --input-len 2048 --existing-ctx 0 --decode-tokens 2 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy"

# With existing KV cache context
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect perf \
    --model-path workload/models/configs/Qwen3-235B-A22B \
    --tp 1 --bs 4 --input-len 512 --existing-ctx 4096 --decode-tokens 2 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy"

# Full pipeline (perf + shapes)
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect all \
    --model-path workload/models/configs/Qwen3-235B-A22B \
    --tp 1 --bs 1 --input-len 2048 --existing-ctx 0 --decode-tokens 2 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy"

# Multi-point sweep
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect all \
    --model-path workload/models/configs/Qwen3-235B-A22B \
    --sweep 1:2048:0 4:2048:0 8:2048:0 --decode-tokens 2 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy"

# GLM-5.2 (MLA + DSA indexer + MoE). Its config declares a 1M context, so the
# KV pool must be capped or the server OOMs before the first forward.
flowsim submit --scheduler local \
    --collect all \
    --model-path /flowsim/workload/models/configs/GLM-5.2 \
    --tp 1 --bs 1 --input-len 2048 --existing-ctx 0 --decode-tokens 4 --gpus 1 \
    --extra-server-opts "--load-format dummy --mem-fraction-static 0.45 --context-length 8192"
```

### Model configs

`workload/models/configs/` holds **truncated** HF configs: layer counts are cut to the
smallest set that still exercises every distinct layer type, while expert counts, hidden
sizes and head counts are left at their real values. Profiling one dense + one MoE layer is
enough to extrapolate the full model, and it keeps a run to a single GPU.

For DeepSeek-style models (`deepseek`, `GLM-5.2`) that means `num_hidden_layers: 2` with
`first_k_dense_replace: 1`, giving layer 0 dense and layer 1 MoE. sglang places MoE layers
using `first_k_dense_replace` and `moe_layer_freq`; the HF-only `mlp_layer_types` /
`indexer_types` lists are truncated to match purely for `transformers` self-consistency.
Models without dense prefix layers (`Qwen3-235B-A22B`) use `num_hidden_layers: 1`.

`GLM-5.2/config_full.json` is the unmodified upstream config, kept so the truncation stays
auditable — it differs from `config.json` only in the four keys above.

For K8s / Slurm clusters, replace `--scheduler local` with `k8s` or `slurm`. See [schedulers/README.md](schedulers/README.md) for full scheduler documentation.

## For Developers

### Customizing Profiling Workloads

For programmatic profiling setup, see `tests/integration/test_profile.py`, which shows how to:

- Launch an sglang server with profiling enabled via environment variables (`SGLANG_TORCH_PROFILER_DIR`, `SGLANG_PROFILE_KERNELS`)
- Run custom benchmarks against the server to generate trace files

Adjust `--server-opts` and `--bench-opts` in `scripts/run_profile.py` to match your model and workload. All `sglang.launch_server` and `bench_serving.py` parameters are supported. See the [sglang profiling documentation](https://docs.sglang.ai/developer_guide/benchmark_and_profiling.html) for details.

### LLMCompass Backend Integration

FlowSim currently integrates with [LLMCompass](https://github.com/TerrenceZhangX/LLMCompass) as a reference GPU performance simulator. In this setup:

- Each parsed kernel (from a FlowSim trace) is turned into a small JSON payload and submitted to the LLMCompass backend via its `/tasks` API.
- The backend estimates runtime characteristics per kernel (e.g., latency) under a user-specified hardware configuration.
- Results are polled asynchronously until all tasks reach a terminal state, then written as JSON artifacts for further analysis.

LLMCompass itself supports richer workflows (e.g., compiling full operator graphs, system-level roofline analysis, and running graphs on real GPUs). FlowSim focuses on the **kernel-level, trace-driven** usage: taking end-to-end traces from real inference workloads and feeding them into a calibrated backend to study per-kernel performance, compare hardware configurations, or validate simulator behavior.

### Kernel metadata and unknown kernels

After you obtain a profile trace (`*.trace.json.gz`), you will typically run the parser once to inspect kernel-level status:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_parse \
  --trace-file /flowsim/server_profile/your-trace-name.trace.json.gz \
  --output-dir /flowsim/server_simulate
```

During parsing, FlowSim looks up kernel metadata (e.g., tensor shapes and dtypes) in `kernels.json`. Any kernels it cannot match are written to `unknown_kernels.json` at the project root, with incomplete or `unknown` parameter descriptions.

To enrich metadata for new or unsupported kernels:

- Open `unknown_kernels.json`, locate the entries of interest, and fill in the missing information (e.g., `operation`, `params[*].role`, `example_dim`, `example_dtype`, `description`).
- Copy the completed entries into `kernels.json` to make them part of the known-kernel database.
- Re-run `scripts/run_parse.py` on your trace; those kernels should now be treated as known and will no longer appear in `unknown_kernels.json`.

Tensor shapes and dtypes for Triton kernels are surfaced via the FlowSim tracing hooks. When `SGLANG_PROFILE_KERNELS=1`, `sglang.launch_server` calls `register_kernels_for_profiling` from `sglang.srt.tracing.hook_register`, which attaches tensor metadata to PyTorch profiler labels for registered kernels. If you introduce custom Triton kernels that still appear as "unknown" after parsing, you may need to extend this registration logic and/or add corresponding entries to `kernels.json`.
